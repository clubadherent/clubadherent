<p align="center"> "Hello there! It seems like you have stepped into my account." 
<p align="center">"My name is Luci and allow me to introduce myself."
<p align="center">ㅡI'm an artist and a writer I tend to procastinate alot but I try my best to make some content.
<p align="center">As you guys noticed, Trey Clover is my favorite character in Heartslabyul and I'm a yumeshipper to him and I am heavily and strictly a non-sharing yumejoshi to him so it makes me very uncomfortable when I see other canon x oc / yumeshippers with him also I feel very uncomfy if you guys whisper a love confession/letter to my Trey skin when I'm using it so please I kindly ask you to respect my boundaries that's all I want. We can talk or interact normally if I do interact with you but please don't talk about how much you love Trey to me and PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT TALK ABOUT YOUR OC X CANON/YUMESHIP OF HIM TO ME...
  
<p align="center"> ✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*
  
<p align="center">If it's platonic or familial it's totally okay as long as there's not any romance happening in your platonic ship with him. We non-sharing yumejoshis tend to get alot of hate in the yume community but most of us are actually chill and decent unlike some other yumeshippers that is truly a bad lemon who harassed their doubles or those "Oshi is Mine" types of person. I will also block Trey doubles out of respect in order to curate my space.
  
<p align=" center">I'm very introverted so I tend to not usually interact with anyone unless I know you. Complimenting my skins is a-okay to me and I can also reply to it when I can. When I'm comfortable with you, I tend to be silly and chaotic but when it comes to serious topics, My demeanor changes alot.

<p align="center">◇ Strictly do not steal or copy my skins or style cause I created all of my skins myself unless I put that it's a tut skin on the name or I gave you permission to do my style. Inspo is okay as long as you ask me.
<p align="center">◇ I'm pretty sensitive so please make sure to interact with extreme caution to me.
<p align="center">◇ I don't roleplay so please do not rp with me out of nowhere unless you are a friend of mine and I will have "SYS" or "RPDNI" on my ponies most entirely meaning, I don't wanna engage in a roleplay with you.
<p align="center">◇ I tend to have anxiety attacks out of nowhere and I usually put "DNIUP", "IWEC", "DNIUF" if I do get some scenarios. 
<p align="center">◇ If I have "AFK" on my name that means I'm away from my phone and is busy irl or doing something else. When I have "SEMI-AFK" my replies tends to be late.
<p align="center">◇ Trey Clover from Twisted Wonderland is heavily my comfort character and like I said, I'm a non-sharing yume to him so I will never consider interacting with you at all if you also have a romantic oc ship with them. I do respect your oc ship but please do not interact with me or talk about your oc ship to them with me for my sake and do respect my boundaries that's all I ask for and nothing else.
<p align="center">◇ I will NOT TOLERATE HARASSMENT towards me or my friends and if you are trying to harass me or my friends, I'll block you immediately.
<p align="center">◇ Do not interact with me if you are a proshipper and just leave me alone.
<p align="center">◇ I am a rareshipper and I prefer it more than popular ships. I also have canon x canon ships that I love so please respect my ships for I respect yours as well.
